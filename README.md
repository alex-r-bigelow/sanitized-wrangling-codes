This repository aims to document the evolution of codes and categories in a team-based [1] Grounded Theory
Method investigation into how diverse data workers think about the design of data abstractions.

Please remember that, in the spirit of open science, this repository is publicly visible, and will be
archived on osf.io. As such, before committing, please remember to check that:

1. No identifiable information about informants or participants is included in anything that you are
   committing
2. Feel free to commit ill-formed codes, however, in the spirit of active citation [2], try to include at
   least one piece of evidence before committing a code:
   - with a link or paper title when the evidence is coming from a publication
   - with a short summary of your observation when the evidence is coming from your field notes, also adding
     a row to informants.csv
   - with a link to the relevant response(s) to the survey (TODO: Alex will add an ability to link to
     filtered sets of responses as soon as possible)
3. You are committing to a branch other than master

Please request a review from one other author before merging a pull request; Github's record of our
discussions, linked to the evolution of codes, is an important part of our audit trail.
