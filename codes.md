# Many people don't feel that what they work with "counts as data"
- Common refrain while soliciting survey participation at both technical conferences, as well as through
  deployment across the University
- Three informants (I-01,I-02,I-04) independently made this observation (on two different occasions) while
  reflecting on their experiences working with / mentoring people new to Data Science
- A regular data science workshop in the humanities tends to get very low attendance; often the same three
  participants
- One Supercomputing participant working on hardware design felt that treating circuit diagrams as "data"
  would be very strange, and perhaps inappropriate
