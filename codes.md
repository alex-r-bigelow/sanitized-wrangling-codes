# Many people don't feel that what they work with "counts as data"
- Common refrain while soliciting survey participation at both technical conferences, as well as through deployment across the University
- Three informants (I-01, I-02, I-04) independently made this observation (on two different occasions speaking with A-1) while reflecting on their experiences working with / mentoring people new to Data Science
- A regular data science workshop in the humanities, run by I-02, tends to get very low attendance; often the same three
  participants
- One Supercomputing survey participant working on hardware design felt that treating circuit diagrams as "data" would be very strange, and perhaps inappropriate

# Many people consider functions as data
  - Conversation after presentation about project with A-1, A-2, I-05: I-05 and A-2 would not consider constraint data, such as for linear or integer programming, as fitting any of our initial six categories. Although I-05 thinks in terms of half-spaces, sub-spaces, etc., "spatial" data, as we use it, seems imprecise

# Many people consider code to be data
  - Conversation with A-1, I-06, I-07, I-08, I-09, I-10, I-11, I-12 about open science and data sharing; code definitely counts as "data," or at least "metadata," in that it tells you where a given dataset came from. Per I-06: "one person's metadata is another person's data."

# Even very technical people find some data abstraction concepts, language foreign
  - One Supercomputing survey participant was confused by "item" vs "attribute" terminology. In their response, "tens of items" was selected (initially thinking about table columns), but then selected millions after discussing with A-1, A-3

# Data design difficult to talk about in isolation from discovery, capture, curation, creation [Muller, CHI 2019]
  - Discussions about data formats within, and more frequently outside of the VIS community, proved very difficult for A-1 to keep focused on design, and quick transitions to other data wrangling considerations, especially provenance were common (specific instances: discussions with I-02, I-03)

# Raw data abstractions difficult to talk about in isolation from software abstractions
  - Conversations proved very difficult to for A-1 focus on how a person thinks about their data; participants frequently pivoted to talking about abstractions imposed by software that were often only loosely associated with the data model itself (such as git's model of remotes and branches with I-02, or Jupyter's statefulness with I-02 and I-13)

# Datasets have varying degress of usability
  - Question was spontaneously posed directly in a conversation by I-14: "what makes data usable?"
